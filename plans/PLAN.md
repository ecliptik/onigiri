# Onigiri — Design & Roadmap

Personal-use calorie/sodium/water tracker for iPhone + Apple Watch. Goal: lose 20 lb, driven by a visible daily energy balance.

## Product decisions (settled)

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Dev account | Free personal team now; paid account later once the app proves itself |
| Food entry | Manual entry + barcode scan (OpenFoodFacts) |
| Goal model | Deficit budget derived from target weight + date, plus trend-based projection |
| Watch scope | Glanceable meter + one-tap water and saved-meal logging; food creation stays on iPhone |
| Nutrients | Calories and sodium only |

## Architecture

### Targets (XcodeGen `project.yml`)

1. **Onigiri** — iOS app, SwiftUI
2. **OnigiriWatch** — watchOS app, SwiftUI
3. **OnigiriKit** — local Swift package shared by both: models, HealthKit service, budget math, OpenFoodFacts client
4. **Widgets** (later phase) — WidgetKit extensions: iPhone home-screen widget + watch complication

### Data: HealthKit is the log store, SwiftData is the library

**Logs → HealthKit** (source of truth for anything time-series):

- Food/meal logging writes `HKCorrelation(.food)` wrapping `dietaryEnergyConsumed` (kcal) + `dietarySodium` (mg) samples, with metadata carrying the food/meal name so today's log can be listed and entries deleted.
- Water logging writes `dietaryWater` samples.
- Reads: `activeEnergyBurned`, `basalEnergyBurned`, `bodyMass` (smart scale), plus `dietaryEnergyConsumed`/`dietaryWater` from all sources (so anything logged elsewhere still counts).

Why: HealthKit syncs iPhone↔Watch automatically (no iCloud needed — critical on a free team), data shows up in the Health app, and there is zero lock-in if you ever switch trackers.

**Library → SwiftData** (local, iPhone-owned):

- `Food` — name, calories (kcal), sodium (mg), serving description, optional barcode
- `Meal` — name + list of (food, quantity) portions
- `GoalSettings` — target weight, target date, start weight/date, water serving size (oz), daily water goal, units

Library and settings are pushed to the watch via WatchConnectivity `applicationContext` (small payload, latest-wins — right fit for a reference list).

### Calorie meter & budget math

- **Meter:** `Intake − (Active + Resting)` for today. Resting energy accrues during the day, so the balance is honest at any hour.
- **Budget:** 20 lb ≈ 70,000 kcal (3,500 kcal/lb). Required daily deficit = remaining kcal ÷ days to target date. Daily budget = expected TDEE (14-day average total burn from HealthKit) − required deficit.
- **Guardrails:** warn when the required deficit exceeds ~1,000 kcal/day or the budget drops below ~1,500 kcal — nudge to move the target date instead.
- **Progress:** 7-day moving average of weight (raw scale readings are noisy) charted against the goal line, with a projected finish date at the current trend.

### Barcode scanning

VisionKit `DataScannerViewController` → OpenFoodFacts REST lookup → prefill the new-food form (name, kcal, sodium; convert salt→sodium ×0.4 when OFF only has salt). Foods are always saved to the local library, so scanning is a one-time event per product and daily logging stays offline.

## Free personal team caveats

- App expires on device after **7 days** — re-deploy weekly (⌘R with iPhone connected, or a scripted `xcodebuild` install).
- Max ~3 free-team apps per device; 10 app IDs per week (we use 2–3 — fine).
- No CloudKit/iCloud, no push — the HealthKit + WatchConnectivity design avoids needing them.
- Upgrading to a paid account later is only a signing-team switch; no redesign.

## Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 0 — Environment**: Xcode 26.6 + iOS/watchOS 26.5 simulators installed. *Remaining when we first deploy to hardware: Apple ID added as personal team in Xcode, Developer Mode on iPhone + Watch.*
- [x] **Phase 1 — Scaffold**: XcodeGen project; iOS + watch apps boot in simulators
- [x] **Phase 2 — Meter**: HealthKit authorization + read pipeline; home-screen calorie meter (intake, burn, balance)
- [x] **Phase 3 — Food**: food library CRUD, logging with sodium, one-tap meals. *Pulled forward from Phase 5: goal settings (target weight/date), deficit budget, and the onigiri daily-goal gauge on Today. Also: app icon (🍙), XCUITest end-to-end flow.*
- [x] **Phase 4 — Water**: quick-add serving button, daily goal ring, per-serving log with delete, settings sheet (serving size + goal in @AppStorage)
- [x] **Phase 5 — Goal**: weight trend chart (Swift Charts: raw weigh-ins + 7-day moving average + target line) with a recency-weighted least-squares projected finish date (raw weigh-ins, 7-day half-life — a fresh diet outweighs the flat weeks before it)
- [x] **Phase 6 — Widgets**: iPhone home-screen widgets (small gauge; medium meter with interactive add-water + configurable add-meal buttons via AppIntents) and watch complications (balance circular/rectangular/inline, water ring). Library/settings moved to an App Group + shared SwiftData store in OnigiriKit. *Watch complications show HealthKit data only until Phase 7 syncs goal/water settings; water ring uses the 64 oz default on watch.*
- [x] **Phase 7 — Watch app**: onigiri gauge + balance home (🍙 logo in title and gauge), one-tap water and synced-meal logging with haptics, WatchConnectivity sync of meals/goal/water settings (phone pushes application context on foreground and after edits; watch persists to shared defaults so complications use synced goal + water goal)
- [x] **Phase 8 — Barcode**: VisionKit DataScanner in the food form (manual-digit fallback where the camera is unavailable) → OpenFoodFacts v2 lookup prefills name/kcal/sodium/serving; prefers per-serving values, falls back to per-100 g, converts salt→sodium (×0.4), tolerates string-typed numbers
- [x] **Phase 8.5 — Gamification**: Calendar tab with a month grid — each day that logged food and met the deficit target earns an 🍙; summary card shows the month's onigiri count and the current streak (an in-progress today doesn't break it)
- [ ] **Phase 9 — Polish** (in progress, driven by on-device feedback): ✅ keyboard Done + drag-dismiss, ✅ rice-paper/toast brand accent (dark-mode adaptive), ✅ swipe-to-edit foods/meals, ✅ Today day browsing, ✅ tappable calendar days, ✅ JSON export/import of the library, ✅ app-icon quick actions (log water / log meal / log food / scan barcode — delivered via a consumable Optional request; an ephemeral Bool handoff went permanently dead after one missed delivery), ✅ widget fixes (config picker reads the App Group meal mirror instead of SwiftData; tap feedback via invalidatableContent). ✅ quick actions and JSON export/import verified end-to-end by opt-in UI tests, ✅ weekly re-deploy script (`scripts/deploy-phone.sh` — phone + watch; watch addressed by hardware UDID for xcodebuild and CoreDevice ID for devicectl), ✅ Settings sheet (water icon 💧/🌊, sodium daily limit with traffic-light coloring, "Calorie display" balance/kcal-left choice, data tools), ✅ extended nutrients (fat/carbs/protein/fiber/sugar → Health), ✅ Foods search + favorites + categories, ✅ OpenFoodFacts text search (search-a-licious; rows lazily fetch full product to show kcal + serving; pick reuses the cached fetch), ✅ portion logging (the portion sheet now confirms every food log, with a meal-slot picker), ✅ QuickLogSheet from Today/"Log a Meal" quick action, ✅ watch on-device install (root cause of invisibility: Mac Bluetooth was off — dev channel needs BT/AWDL), ✅ compact watch home (headline number + two buttons, honors the calorie-display setting), ✅ kcal-left option synced to watch + complications, ✅ Today log grouped into collapsible Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner/Snack sections with per-slot totals (slot stored in HealthKit metadata `OnigiriMealCategory`, inferred from time of day when absent: 5–11/11–15/15–18/18–23, late night = snack), ✅ library + quick-log sorted by favorites then current meal slot, ✅ crash-loop fix: Food↔MealItem inverse (nullify) + Core Data pre-flight store repair (`LibraryMaintenance`) for stores poisoned by pre-inverse deletes. Remaining: verify watch complications on a watch face; watch is one deploy behind (unreachable during last two installs).
